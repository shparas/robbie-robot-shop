**Robbie Robot Shop**
---------------------

This is the project I created when I first learned
object oriented programming and GUI in C++ back in
early 2017.

The code is pretty straight forward and if you
need any clarification or help, please email me at 
git@eparas.com.

**To run, go to code directory and run the commands:**  
$make purge  
$make  
  
**To use:**  
$make start  
OR  
$./gui  
  
**Instruction:**  
Run the compiled program and go to Create > Head to 
create head model. Then create Torso, Locomotor, 
Battery and Arm in same way.

Then go ahead and create your first robot model.

Then create Customer and Employee/Sales_associate
in order to create or manage orders from Shop.

To view what you've created, go to report and
click on what you want to see. Remember that all
weights are in pound, costs in dollar and so on
(meaning standard units used).

To sell or manage orders, click on 'Shop'. To
You can restore or remove all data (BEAWARE)
by going to File > Restore. You can reload the data
in the same way (works if you paste all the .file
in current directory as well).

To prevent program crash, never leave any input
field blank. If you want nothing, put some space
or 0. If it doesn't work by any chance, remove all
files with extension .file and run it again.

Use 'make purge' and then 'make' to build it again
for ease.
